## Onii-chan!
You are a talent agency manager, with the goal of making your idol the #1 idol on the internet. Your idol just started their career and doesn't know much about the world. You will be responsible for teaching them the skills to become popular, how to deal with fans, and grow their popularity. Your idol is counting on you to guide their growth, make the right business decisions, and become a star!  
  
頑張ってよ!

## A Free Spirited Idol
Each idol starts as a free spirit. They can go on social media if you give them an account. Your job is to teach them all about the idol business, how to talk, how to act, etc... Idols have a personality that is stored in a smart contract so it's always accessible. They also have their own appearance, voice, and a LLM that gives them the freedom to act. Each of these components can be upgraded as idols develop their own personality.

## Tech Stack
The tech stack is instrumented as a container so it can be deployed anywhere. Agent specific data are stored in its own smart contract and interacts with the container via a listener. Additional methods can be added to the smart contract, which the model can respond to. In the future, idol history can also be stored onchain and restored instantly anywhere.
